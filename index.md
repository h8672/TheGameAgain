## About the game

Wanted to make a game that can be played in PC in different OS and with a controller if prefer it over mouse and keyboard.

Also want the game to be more dynamic in gameplay as possible with no extra UI to hide things in screen. It would also be simpler to create then.

***

## Project information

The game engine is Unity3D, platforms Windows, Linux and Mac.

The game can be played using mouse and keyboard or controller which will have the main focus. I'm quite bored on the basic PC inputs...

Gameplay aim is dynamic where player moves around and receives possible actions when nearing objects of interest.

Development will be made in cycles of Alpha, Beta and finally release.
Alpha consist of bare mechanics the game uses, Beta focuses on improving their quality and release will come when **I** (the developer) am satisfied in the beta result. The game content is practically to test those mechanics quite freely and is added in beta phase.

There's no release date at the moment. The progress may not be frequent either.
