# Short book to code

It might look neat, want it to, and might not work that well... However, this is to speed up development, learning, help get the vision of required objects and requirements.

If the milestone is more complex than previously thought, this is a step where it might be noticed early. If it was much simpler, bonus received.

This book was created by H8672 and shared in [github](https://github.com/h8672/TheGameAgain/blob/master/CodeBook.md). It doesn't aim to tell everything, just to log an okay practice to do code in okay process. The rest is up to the reader as it is really vague how to code or write documents.

This book aim is to help with:

- Research
- Reading documents
- Create documents
- Fortify learning
- Quicken the development speed

NOTE: there might be steps you just might skip totally.

## Documentation

Make document of the milestone, steps for it and search for required methods and theorize the step method in about one line explaining what it is, what it does, what is it expected to do and when or where is it used.
Think how long it takes to develop and multiply it by 3 and make note.

Make changelog where you take times how long it took to create functions for the milestone step.

When done with code, review the step, remember the drawbacks of your theory and write short feedback.

## Coding

While coding never delete a line that didn't work. Just comment it out.

When done with code, it works correctly, duplicate the file and clear the additional comments out from the .

go back to documentation to do the log for time spent and create feedback about the things that didn't work as you thought. This is to learn the code.
